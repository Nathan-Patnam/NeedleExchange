# NeedleExchange

NeedleXchange is a web app designed to help organize and publicize needle exchanges. Event organizers can quickly
and easily create needle exchanges anywhere in the US, and nearby subscribers will recieve notifications when the
event is created. NeedleXchange subscribers can be drug addicts, or the family and friends of drug addicts and everything
is completely anonymous. The only information we need is a zip code or address and a phone number or email address.
